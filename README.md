# **WARNING** This mod is no longer undetected, since Import/Export Online update in December of 2016. (Using DirectX library's to load module DLLs as a backdoor; both dinput8.dll and dsound.dll)
# JTA-O
JTA mod (my personal mod) for GTA, recreated for Online use.
## What can this mod do?
Currently, it uses a command line in order to process commands. Originally multiple keyboard bindings were in use, but once too many command were in use I had to adopt a new style.
The only to keybindings are as follows:
* **F7**: Open Console input window
* **L**: Vehicle speed modifier

## What if R* sees this mod?
There is nothing they will do most likley. It is legal to make mods, and this mod works for both singleplayer and multiplayer, so the chance of it being requested for takedown is an unlikley scenario.

This mod **is** made for online use, I recommend my JTA mod for non-online, created curtousy of [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and [ScriptHookVDotNet](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet), in which you can find here (awaiting link as repo is not online).

## What was this mod made using?
This mod was created using Sudomod; host on Bitbucket [here](https://bitbucket.org/infamousdevteam/sudomod/).

Sudomod is included in the repo as for convenience.

## How do I install this mod?
Click on the **'releases'** tab, you can download a zip file containing all the nessasary files.

**All** files go into the GTA V root directory, where GTA5.exe is located.

If you wish to build this yourself, go ahead; just make sure the DLL name matches the one included as the 'FileName' attrib in dinput.ini.

## I know what I'm doing and I want to make my own mod for online/offline.
**Online**: I recommend using Sudomod. Do **NOT** use this mod as a base. It's filled with terrible programming practices and a Java programmer attemtping to program in C++. Please, use the Sudomod base, not this.

**Offline**: If you're a C++ programmer or know any other low-leveled language, I recommened [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/). If you know Java, C#, or any other high-leveled language, I recommend [ScriptHookVDotNet](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet).
